Cleaned and merged academic data.

Conducted exploratory data analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib to uncover trends and feature relationships.

Engineered a binary classification label: Pass (score ≥ 10) vs Fail.

Built two classification models using:

Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier

Evaluated models using:

Accuracy, Confusion Matrix and F1-Score

**Section 2:** Music Store Insights (SQL – Chinook Database)
Dataset: Chinook SQLite Database

Wrote and executed SQL queries to:

Identify top 5 customers by purchase amount.
